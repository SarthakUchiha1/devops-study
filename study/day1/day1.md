### Day 1 

Today I learned about the OSI model , TCP/IP model and the components about these models 


OSI model is a therotical model where as the TCP/IP model is a Practical model 

An OSI model contains 7 layers such as 

    -> Application layer -> Presentation Layer -> Session Layer -> Transport Layer -> Network Layer -> datalink layer -> Physical Layer 


    {              Application Layer (in TCP/IP model)        } -> {Transport layer} ->{Internet layer} -> {network layer }
